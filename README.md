#Beastro App
Feed your furry friends!

## Inspiration
Going on a trip? Can't rely on roommates to feed your pet or do you have no roommates? No worries! Now you can feed your pet remotely!

## What it does
At the push of a button, you can feed your pet via the "Beastro Bowl" - an IoT piece of hardware and service that allows you to monitor your pet remotely.

## How I built it
Team of 5 - using Edison board, Grove kit sensors, and a javascript app. We are a team that came up with an idea and chose an area of expertise to focus on: hardware, service, UX, and UI. Working together, we each researched, banded, and hacked on our little piece of the puzzle and came together to build Beastro! We even utilized 3D printing to build a component we did not have.

## Challenges I ran into
Communication between hardware and web app. 3D printing time requirement.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning node.js, upcycling, leveraging everyone's skills in order to create a product everyone is proud of, learning how to use a 3D printer!

## What I learned
Node.js, to install programs before hand, 3D printing, AJAX calls

## What's next for Beastro
Sensor to measure when there is food in the bowl and when there isn't.
